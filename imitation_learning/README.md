# Imitation Learning Techniques

### Instructions

- Install pybullet with `pip install pybullet`

- Open `Behavioural Cloning and Dagger.ipynb` to see an implementation of behavioural cloning and DAGGER with pybullet gym's Humanoid Flagrun environment.

You'll train a humanoid runner to mimic an expert demonstrator, producing an agent that can run towards targets, and get up after falling over.

** You can run this notebook on a laptop CPU -- no GPU needed!**
